RobotPlayground
===============

This is a bit of a sandbox for code for controlling robots from an Arduino. Although all the code passes compilation it might not work as intended on the robot (won't be able to test with the robot for a few more weeks).

Just copy the whole RobotPlayground directory structure into your sketchbook folder. Should look a bit like the following

 * Arduino/
 ** libraries/
 ***  QMotor/
 **** QMotor.cpp
 **** QMotot.h
 *** Sensor3204/
 **** Sensor3204.cpp
 **** Sensor3204.h
 ** UseSensors/
 *** UseSensors.ino

(Obviously additional code will be added overtime and this list won't be maintained!)

Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE and then it can be uploaded to the Arduino board.
